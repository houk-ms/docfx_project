### 1. Create a Survey from a Template

Select the button "Create Survey" from any page on SurveyMonkey.com and then choose the "Team Templates" tab. 

Note: If you see an example of another team's survey that you'd like to use, request to them that they share their Survey with you (instructions [here](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Sharing-Surveys#Share). Once shared, you should be able to select the "Clone an Existing Survey" tab. 

### 2. Edit the Survey

Once you create your survey, start by [adding questions](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Editing-Questions) from the left sidebar. You can add different [question types](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Available-question-types-and-formatting-options) from the BUILDER section of the sidebar, or choose pre-written questions from our [Question Bank](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-is-Question-Bank). After you add a question, take a look under the Edit and Options tabs to further customize it.

If your survey is long, [break it up into multiple pages](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Adding-and-Managing-Pages). Respondents will feel they are making progress as they reach each new page, and it can help you organize your survey into logical sections.

If you started from a [template](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-to-create-a-survey?bc=Creating_Surveys), review the survey and see if there are opportunities to personalize it. Most of our pre-written questions allow you to customize certain parts of the question text to ensure that the question is relevant to your survey. You may also want to add additional questions of your own, or remove questions that aren't useful to you.

### 3. Final Checklist

- **Proofread your survey** (and email, landing page, etc.) to fix any grammar or content issues
- **Your message clear, concise, and accurate.** The customer will easily understand why you're asking for their participation and what you plan to do as a result of the data/feedback.
  - The subject line and header simply communicate the reason for the email.
  - Body text is customer value centered
  - A single Call-to-Action is clear and easy to identify
- **Email and Survey link have both been tested and reviewed by someone else** (preferably someone unaware of your business goals and can act as a customer)
