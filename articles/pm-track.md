# PM Onboarding Track

Program Management in Cloud + AI is a broad and varied role with four core responsibilities: strategy & planning, understanding customer experience, defining the go to market strategy, and working through the rhythm of the business. 

For new hires, you may check with your manager or pay attention to mail notification about registration opening for the following two Bookcamps. 

- Azure Bootcamp (https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AEL)
    - Azure Engineering Boot Camp is an immersive training experience for FTEs designed for Software Engineers and Program Managers new to Cloud + AI. The live lecture + hands-on-lab experience provides training, guidance, and insights into core Azure, as well as the tools, processes, and best practices used to build Azure, or build on top of Azure, so that new hires can quickly get up to speed. 
- DevDiv Bootcamp (https://aka.ms/AboutDevDivBootcamp)
    - At least once a year, DevDiv IDC and DevDiv China will co-host a bootcamp to introduce new hire to DevDiv culture, values, and overall business strategy for Developer Tools & Services. At the bootcamp, you will meet other new hires and hear from various Engineering and PM leaders across the division.
